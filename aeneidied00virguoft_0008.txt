Rome¹, and in G. 3. 46 (on the occasion of the triumph of

Augustus after his victories in the East, B. C. 29) the poet
announces his intention of celebrating the event in verse.

XVhether any poem directly in praise of Augustus was begun
or not, it must have been speedily abandoned for one of
more comprehensive design, for some three years later we
find Augustus asking for a specimen of the Aenez'd then in
progress, and in 23 B. C., three entire books (the second,
fourth, and sixth according to Suetonius) were recited before
the court. There are certain indications that the Third
Book was written before the Second2‚ and it is likely, in
desault of any direct evidence, that the composition of the
first Book (or parts ofitJ) preceded that of the Fourth.

The time chosen by virgil for the production of his great
work was the beginning of a new era in the history of Rome.
The civil wars were over, the long-expected reign of peace
had begun, the consolidation of the empire and revival of
the national religion were being effected under the auspices
of Augustus. Everything favoured the composition of a
poem, which was to be in the fullest sense a national epic of
the Roman people and a monument of Roman greatness.
Nor was anyone better fitted for the task than Virgil, who,
as the author of the Georgia, was deservedly reckoned
among the first poets of his time. His choice of subject was
determined by the opportunity thus afforded him of connecting
the early history of his country with the famous legends of
the heroes of Τῑογ, as well as by the national belief of the
Romans in their Trojan origin3 above all by the claims of
the imperial family to berthe representatives in name and
race of the son of the great Aeneas 2——

‘Iulius‚ a magno demissum nornen Iulo' j1. 2861

Moreover, the very vagueness of the traditions connected

¹ ‘ Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem vellit et ad-
monuit,' etc„ that is to say, he thought of attempting an heroic poem,
but found the subject too hard sor him.
