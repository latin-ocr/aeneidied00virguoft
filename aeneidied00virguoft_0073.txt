the extreme south of the peninsula, to which part the name Italia
was of old confined. As a Greek name it should mean the land
of wine (οἶνος) or the vine. Italia is said to be from vitulus
([ῖίταλος), Oscan villu, meaning the land of cattle, but this is
doubtful. It is at all events the same word as Siculi and Siceli.
As usual, the name of a mythical king Italus was invented from
the name of the country. The z' in Italia is really short, as in
Itali 1. 109 and elsewhere, but ἵ is freely used when wanted, as
in Itala (ἵ) 3. 185 etc.‚ (but Itala (ιῖ in 6. 757, 10. 780). gentem=

is perhaps one of themx and were probably left in this state, to
be filled up or altered at a final revision, which was prevented
by the poet’s untimely death. Others 'like 1. 56οἵ make a 16111111,Γ
pause before passing to a fresh suhject; these were no doubt pur-
posely left unfinished for the sake of effect, and also to vary the
monotony of a continuous succession of hexameterS. Later atte mpts
have been made to complete some of these lines—e. g. ‘ huc cunctis
fuit ire voluptas' here—but they had better have been left alone.

535. assurgens combines the two ideas of the star’s rising and
that of the waves (Cf. Orion is called ‘ aquosus’ 4. 52. In 7. 719
his setting, not his rising, is said to be stormy3 this, which took
place in autumn, represents the fact, but Virgil is not always
particular in such matters as these.
