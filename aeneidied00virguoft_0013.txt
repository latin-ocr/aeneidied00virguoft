fall of Troy and his own wanderings. The F irst Book
continues the narrative to his arrival at Carthage and his
receptiort there; the Fourth tells the tragic story of Dido's
passion for Aeneas, her desertion by him and consequent
suicide; the Fifth describes the return of the Trojans to
Sicily, the funeral games in honour of Anchises, and the
departure for Italy. In the Sixth Book Aeneas descends
into the lower world and meets the spirit of his father
Anchises, who unfolds to him the history of his descendants,
the future heroes of Rome. In the Seventh he reaches
Latium, allies himself with king Latinus, and is betrothed
to his daughter Lavinia3 but Turnus, chief of the Rutuli and
a suitor of Lavinia, rouses the Italian tribes to armS. The
Eighth Book relates how Aeneas made an alliance with
Evander, an Arcadian prince settled at Pallanteum on the
Tiber, and concludes with a description of the famous shield
with its historic designs¹, fashioned by Vulcan and presented
by Venus to her son. The remaining books are one long
narrative of battles, varied however by romantic episodes.
Aeneas gets succour from the Etruscans, who assist him in
raising the siege of his camp, beleaguered during his absence
by Turnus and his Rutulians. The fortune of war now turns
against the Latins, and to save further bloodshed Turnus
agrees to meet Aeneas in single combat. The covenant is
made and ratified, but is immediately broken by the Rutuli,
and the battle rages afresh. At last Turnus, roused to
action, goes forth to confront his adversary, and is slain.

Virgil never lived to revise-the Aenez'd. In 19 B.C. he
started on a journey into Greece, and meeting Augustus at
Athens decided to return with him. He died a few days
after landing at Brundisium, on September 22, at the age
of 51, and was buried near Naples. His tomb bore the
inscription—

‘Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
Parthenope; cecini pascua rura duces?
