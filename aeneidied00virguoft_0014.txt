10 INTRODUCTJON.

In preparing the notes Ι have consulted mainly the
standard commentary by Professor Conington (as well as his
prose translation of Virgilj and the school editions of Virgil
by &Vagner (1861) and Dr. Kennedy (1876). These are
indicated by the letters C., W. and K. respectively. I have
occasionally referred to Forbiger's three-volume edition
(1852) and to that of Heyne and Wagner (1830), and I arn
greatly indebted to Professor Sellar⁷s Vz'rgz'l (1877) and to
the valuable Suggeslz'ons, etc. by Professor Nettleship and his
smaller treatise on Vergil in Messrs, Macmillan’s series of
‘ Classical writers,² published in 1879. Citations in the notes
from other authors or from portions of Virgil’s own works
other than the First Book of the Aenez‘d have been generally
given in full.
