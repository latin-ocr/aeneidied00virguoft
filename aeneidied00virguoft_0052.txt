AENEJD J. 37-85.

37. mene, etc. The infin. of indignant exclamation, ‘am l to
abandon my purpose baffled?' Cp. 1. 97. In Greek the article τό
is generally added, as in Ar. ,Nubes 819 τὸ Δία νομίζειν, ‘ the idea of
your believing in Zeus! '

39. quippe, ‘because forsooth,’ partly, but not wholly ironical,
since Juno could not alter destiny, onlydelay its accomplishment.

40—42. The story was that Ajax had offered violence (noxam) to
Cassandra in a temple of Pallas Athene, hence the goddess punished
him as here described. Homer, Od. 4. 503, etc.‚ says that Poseidon
slew him for his insolent boasting by eleaving the rock on which he
had taken refuge from shipwreck. furias, ‘ infatuation ’ (ri-tryv‘j.
Oilei is either in apposition with Aiacis (though it was really his
sather’s name) or gen. of the adj. OilffiszOz'lidc-s. Ajax, son of
Oileus, must be distinguished from the greater Ajax, son of Tela-
mon. ipsos, ‘the crews.' Cp. Hom. Il. 14. 47 πρὶν πυρὶ νῆας
ἐνιπρῆσαι, κτεῖναι δὲ καὶ αὐτούς. In l. 42 ipsa=‘with her own
hand: usurping the province of Juppiter. The various uses of ipse
should be noted Kl. 1453 E. 4. 21 ; G. 1. 16, 338).

45. infixit, etc„ ‘impaled on a jagged rock.' scopulo is the
instrumental ablative, lit. ‘ with,’ etc.

46, 47. incedo implies majestic and queenly bearing.’ Cp. 1.
405, 5. 67, 68 ‘ qui viribus audax Aut iaculo incedit melior.' The
conception of Juno ,QHera> as ‘ queen of the gods ’ is a later develop-
ment. In Homer she is simply the wife of Zeus, but not herself
supreme. soror et coniunx, κασιγνήτην ἄλοχόν τε Hom. Il. 16. 43²·
She was the daughter of Cronos (Saturnj, hence called Saturnia
l. 23.

48, 49. Since adorat praeterea ζ( henceforth ') :adorabz'zg the fut.
imponet naturally follows. But there is good authority for im-
ponit, implying that Juno is surprised that she still llas any wor-
shippers now that she has been disgraced. praeterea will then have
the force of the Greek ἔπειτα ‘ after this (insum) honorem,
‘ sacrifice‚’ as osten elsewhere. Cp. ‘ meritos honores ' 3. 118, ‘ per-
fecto honore' z‘b. 178.

51, 52. feta, ‘ teeming.‘ Austris, ‘ storm-winds' generally.
Aeolia is supposed to be Lipari, one of the Insulae Vulcaniae, lying
north of Sicily. The origin ofthe myth in a vola-anic island is obvious.

53. luctantes, ‘struggling’ against the bars. indignantes {55}
expresses the same idea.

56. celsa aree = simply ⁴ on high,’ without reference to any actual
stronghold inside or outside the cavern. The citadel being the
dwellingssplace of ancient despots‚ aaa· is here used as a symbol of
sovereignty.
