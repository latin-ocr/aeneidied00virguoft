NOTES.

AENEI 1) 1.

[THE four lines [Νι ago . . . horrentia Martis are probably not
genuine. They are wanting in several of the best MSS„ and in one
they are written in the margin by a later hand. The testimony of
Ovid, Trist. 2. 533, and of Martial, S. 56. 19, seems to show that
‘Arma virumque ' were recognised as the opening words of the Aeneid,
and the‘Avapa μοι ἔννεπε, etc. of Homer, Osi. 1. 1, points in the same
direction. In any case these lines cannot be taken as merely intro—
ductory, being, if allowed to stand, in close grammatical connexion
' with the first line of the poem. They express however the facts of
the case as regards Virgil's successive efforts in the Eclogues and
Georgics, and have become to some extent famous through imitation

by Spenser in the opening of the Faery Queene, and by Milton in the
l‘aradise Regae'ned]

Line 1. The words arma virumque arc a sort of trumpet—note
introducing the theme of the poem, as an epio of war, and its hero
Aeneas, who is described but not mentioned by name till 1. 92.
virgil does not, like Homer, begin by invoking the Muse: see 1. 8.
primus, probably ‘first 3⁷ though some render it ⁶ of yore.’ Antenor
(l. 242) had previously founded Patavium, but this was in Cisalpine
Gaul, not in ‘ Italy: as the name was understood in Yirgil's time.

2. fato with profugus, Τ he Roman belief that the fortunes
of Aeneas were controlled by destz'ny is in fact the ground-work οἱ
the poem. See Introduction, p. 7. Lavina, said by anticipation
of the town which Aeneas was to found in Latium, to be called
Lavinium, after the name of his betrothed (12. 194). [If Lavinia
is the right reading, the last two syllables must be slurred into one
(by synizesis), like omnia in 6. 33, abiete 2. 16. But Lavina is
better supported, and Lavinium must be formed from it (like
Lucania from Lucanus, etc.), not vice versa] N ote the difference
of quantity in Lavinia here and Ldz'z'm' 1. 2 58. So Sychaeus 345
and Sjclzaeum 348, Cytlzk‘rea 257 and Cytlaera 680. In proper
names some laxity was allowed and practised.

3. ille emphasises the hero, ‘a matt much busseted' C. Cp.
5. 457 ‘nunc dextra ingeminans ictus, nunc ille sinistra? Hom.
