Book of the Iliad, and with Achilles in the Twentieth, and is
saved on the former occasion by his mother Aphrodite, on the
latter by Poseidon, who predicts the continuance of his reign
at Troy and that of his descendants after him (Il. 20. 307 J.
The various legends in connexion with his wanderings are
recounted in some detail‘by Professor Nettleship in his
handbook to Virgi113 a brief summary is all that need here
be given. The earliest traditions represent Aeneas as pass-
ing from Troy into Thrace (Aen. 3. 13), where local names
like Aenus, Aenea, etc. may have given rise to the legend.
He is also heard of in Delos, Leucas, Zacynthus and the
mainland of Epirus (ib. 74, :Uo—293), and Virgil further
follows ancient tradition in bringing him to Segesta in Sicily
and thence to the South and VVest coasts of Italy. The
legends of Aeneas in Latium are of later origin. The Greeks
had represented the Romans as of Achaean extraction, and
this belief prevailed till about the third century B.C., when
the Sicilian historian Timaeus laid the foundation of the
Trojan story by assigning a Trojan origin to some images
of the Roman Penates at Lavinium. The theory of their
descent from Aeneas was henceforth maintained by the
Romans, and by the second century it became generally
recognised. The reception of Aeneas at Carthage found no
place in the earlier legends; when and by whom the idea
was started is unknown. It was however adopted by the
poet Naevius in the third century, and is a prominent feature
in Virgil’s narrative, though it involves the awkward neces-
sity of taking Aeneas srorn Sicily to Carthage and back again
(in the Fifth Book) before he is allowed to pursue his voyage
to Italy.

The Aenez'd naturally divides itself into two equal parts;

his work in Italy, the remainder relating his achievements
there after landing. The story begins in order of time with
the Second and Third Books, in which Aeneas narrates the
