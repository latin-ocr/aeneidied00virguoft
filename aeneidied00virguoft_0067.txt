NOTES.

53 ·’ pruna: honos‚' etc. where, as here, there is a pause in the sense.
These are the only two instances in which Virgil has kept a slzorl
vowel unelided.

407. totiens. virgil records only one appearance, 2. 590, and
then Venus came without disguise. Aeneas therefore exaggerates in
the bitterness of his disappointment. tu quoque, i. e. ·’ you like the
rest‚’ in reference to his persistent ill-fortune.

409. veras, i. e. without restraint, as a son should talk with his
mother.

411. aere, ‘mist.' cp. Hom. vd. s. 14 ἀμφὶ δ’ Ἀθήνη πολλὴν ἠέρα
χεῦε . . . μή τις, etc.

414. moliri, in its secondary sense of ’contrive3' cp. ‘fugam
moliri ’ 2. 109. The verb implies labour and ‹liffxculty; here the
idea is that of a heavy obstacle molcs placed 111 their path.

415. sublimis, ‘high in air‚' ‘ alost,' as in 1. 259. At Paphos,
in Cyprus, was a celebrated temple of Venus, hence she is often
called Paphia. The whole island was sacred to her. See on
‘ Idalium’ l. 681.

416. laeta. may be contrasted with ‘tristior’ 1. 288, since Venus
had now gained her point. But it also adds force to suas = ‘ her
loved abode.'

417. centum arae, an exaggeration‚ as Homer Od. 8. 363 mentions
only one τέμενος βωμός τε θυήεις 1111ε1106 ture calent, etc). There
is a similar exaggeration in 4. 199, where Juppiter Ammon is said to
have a hundred temples and altars.

418. corripuere viam, ‘pushed on their ways So raptim,
⁶ with speed.’

419. plurimus, adverbial, ‘hangs massive over.' Cp. E. 7. 60
‘Iuppiter . . . descendet plurimus imbri,’ i. e. ·will descend in
copious rain)

421. magalia, ‘hats-,³ a Carthaginian word ,also 111 4. 259‘,
probably the same as ‘ mapalia’ G. 3. 340.

422. strepit-um, ‘din of the busy crowd? strata viarum z
stratas vias, cp. l. 310 n. The phrase is from Lucretius 4. 415.
So ⁶ angusta viarum’ 2. 332, ·' opaca locorum’ 2. 725, etc.

423, 424. ducere muros, ·’ build the line of walls.' moliri,
'‘ upraise3’ see on 1. 414.

subvolvere, ‘roll up ' from the level ground.

425. optare, ‘choose.’ Cp. 3. 109 ‘optavitque locum regn0.’
sulco, probably the ‘trench’ in which the foundations were to be
laid.

426. This line interrupts the description, and is rather incon-
sistent with l. 507, where Dido herself is said to administer justice.
