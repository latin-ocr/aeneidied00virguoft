AENEID J. 429-473-

But there is no sign of interpolation, and virgil doubtless (as the
epithet sanetum shows) borrowed this part of his description from
the institutions of the Roman republic. iura . . . legunt, a zeugma
(cp. l. 355), the proper word with iura or leges being constituunt.

429. theatri, etc. This description again is transferred to
ancient Carthage from Rome, as it w'as in Virgil’s own time. For
similar anachronisms see ll. 182, 469, 505.

430. qualis, etc., i.e. ‘like bees that labour busily,' etc. exercet,
‘ keeps employed ; ’ cp. l. 499. The rest is but slightly varied from
the description of actual bees in G. 4. 162, etc. lt is partly imi-
tated by Milton in P. L. 1. 769, etc., ‘ as bees in springtime, when
the sun with Taurus rides, pour forth their populous youths.'

432. liquentia from the deponent lz‘quz', but ‘liquentia’ 5. 238
is from quque. The old doubtful quantity of the ί is shown in
Lucr 4. 1 ²59 ‘ crassaque conveniunt liquidis et liquida crassis?

433. stipant, ‘ mass together.’ Cp. στείβειν, ‘to tread7' στίβος,
‘ path,’ στῖφος, ‘ crowd.'

434, 435. agmine sacto, cp. 1. 82 n. For the order of words

ignavum fucos pecus cp. E. 3. 3 ‘infelix . . . oves pecus.’
438. Aeneas has now descended the hill and is about to enter the
citv ΛΥ.)

440. miscet is possibly intransitive. but se may be supplied
from the preceding line. Cp. 1. 587. ulli, a tolerably common
poetic use of the dat. of the agent after passive verbs when not in
the gerundis-e. Cp. ll. 326, 494, 7. 507 ‘cuique repertum‚‘ Ov.
Trc'sl⁶ 5. 10. 37 ‘non intellegor ulli,’ Juv. 6. 559 ‘formidatus
Othoni,' etc.

441. umbra is the best attested reading, but some MSS. have
umbrae, which is more euphonious after mecha. So we may say
either ‘luxuriant in’ or ⁶ ofshade.’

442, 443. primum adm), may mean either on their arrival,
or when the excavations began NVJ). signum = ‘ omen.’

444, 445. aeris equi, i. e. a war horse. With fore supply a verb
from monstrarat, ·’ for by this she portended,' etc. facilem victu,
abl. of respect = ‘wealthy.’ Facilis victus, ‘easy,’ or ‘luxurious
living? is the usual form of expression.

446, 447. Sidonia, but ‘Sidoniam' in 1. 678: see on ll. 2, 257,
343, also 533. numine, ‘presence‚' from the idea of the gods
dwellz‘ng in their shrines. Cp. l. 16.

448, 449. nexae aare, ⁵ clamped’ or ‘ overlaid with bronze ' =
aeratae, the trabes being probably ‘door-posts.⁷ [With the other
reading nixae, trabes is the ‘architrave ' which rests on ‘pillars.’]
