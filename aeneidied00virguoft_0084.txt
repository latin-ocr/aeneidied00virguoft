Carthaginian Iopas.

‘water’ (l. 123 ns, as in Lucret. 1. 714, where the four elements
are said to be composed ·’ ex igni terra atque anima . . . et imbri.’

744. Hyadas (bafias -τί ΡΙω-ἱειε,’ since their spring rising marked
the beginning of the rainy season. geminos Triones, the Great
and Little Bear, lit. ‘ploughing oxen’ ζι- T erz‘ones from tereres, a
name given to the seven stars of the Bear. Hence Septenaria in
the singular ε the North (G. 3. 3SIJ. This lIne is repeated in
3. 516.

745, 746. Repeated from G. 2. 481, 482. These passages and
the song of Silenus in the 6th Eclogue remain as evidences of

the allusion may be to the horses Diomede took srom Rhesus

from Aeneas himself Xll. 5. 323, etc.) unless we can imagine virgil
to have been ignorant or forgetsul of a story so well known from
Homer.

753. immo ζμὲν οὖν’, ‘nay rather' tell us the whole story, instead
