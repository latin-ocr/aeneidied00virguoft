675-728), representing the chief events in the history of
Rome, from the earliest times to the victory at Actium, and
the triumphant return of Augustus from his Eastern cam-
paigns.

Professor Sellar has rightly observed that the line ‘tantae
molis erat Romanam condere gentem‚⁷ and not the ‘arma
virumque' with which the poem opens, is ‘⁴ the real keynote ’¹
to the Aeneia( The hero is represented as fighting his way
through overwhelming obstacles, but all the while under
the guidance of an irresistible power, which enables him in
the end to prevail. The doctrine of the sovereignty of Fate,
and of a divine Providence directing the progress of their
empire‚ was finnly held by the Romans: and this conception
is maintained throughout the Aeneidk Gods and men are
alike subject to Destiny3 even Juppiter cannot control nor
alter its decrees‚ he only knows and declares thern :—

‘Longius et volvens fatorum arcana movebo' (l. 262¹.

Those who resist the Fates must fail, or perish in the
attempt. Juno herself is powerless to do more than delay
the issue for a time (l. 39 n.J): Venus, on the other hand,
assists Fate by her exertions for Aeneas, though once, in
alarm for his present safety (l. 661), she unwittingly retards
his progress towards the appointed goal. Aeneas is forget-
ful of his high destinies as long as he remains with Dido:
after a twice-repeated warning he has no choice but to
abandon her, and the ruin of the unhappy queen (like that of
Ajax in the Sophoclean tragedy) is the inevitable result of
her opposition to the divine will, in detaining the hero from
the fulfilment of his destined mission.

The Homeric Aeneas is the son of Anchises by Aphrodite ;
he is not a hero of the first rank, but heis renowned for bravery
and held in honour among his countryment—dvr'm ὅντ’ ἴσον
ε’τίυμεν”Εκτορι δίῳῗ. He fights with Diomedes in the Fifth
