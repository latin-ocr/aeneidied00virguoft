AENEJJ) J. 662—698.

the wily serpent. F orbiger quotes Plaut. Pers. 2. 4. 28 ‘tamquam
proserpens bestia est bilinguis et scelestus.’ [The supposed allusion
to Pygmalion is less likely; avarice and eruelty, rather than treachery,
are his prominent vices, and he is besides an exceptional character
among the Tyrians, ‘ scelere ante alios immanior' l. 342]

662. urit, ‘disquiets lit. ‘ scorches’, her? atrox refers to her
sterce persecution of Aeneas. Cp. 11. 279, 280. '

664. solus, etc. ‘thou who alone art my strength.' Cp. Ov. Her.

of solus and unus rarely, if ever, occur.

665. Typhoia. i. e. the bolts with which Juppiter slew the
monster Typhoeus. (See Class. Diet.)

667, 668. ut, ‘hom' like m‘i in l. 466. iactetur, etc., cp. ll.
3, 4. For the -ffr before a vowel see on ll. 308, 651. So ‘obrui-
mi‘tr' 2. 411, ‘alloquitsu' 4. 222, ·’ datfir’ 5. 284. This -τιν was not

like the -or of the first person) originally long.

669. not-a, sor notum (est) a rather free adaptation of the Greek
use of a neut. pl. adj. for the singular; this being almost confined to
the verbal adj. impersonal, as πολεμητέα ἐστίν, or to instances in
which an infinitive clause follows, as ἀδύνατα ἧν ἐπιστρατεύειν Thuc.
3. 88. Herodotus however has δῆλα ὅτι δεῖ ἕνα βασιλέα γενέσθαι,
and a few similar instances.

671. Iunonia hospitia, really of course Dido's, but Carthage
was Juno's town .l= 155, and Venus naturally feared laer maehi-
nations.

672. cessabit, se. luno from Iunonia. cardine, lit. ‘hinge,'
i. e. turning-point or ‘ crisis of affairs.'

any power above ' even Juno'S.

675. meeum, ‘' on my side’ [with teneaturss, or possibly ‘with a
love equal to mine.’ [The objection that Dido's love for Aeneas
could not be like that of a mother has little force; the sole point

10. 22. So ‘noster amor,’ ‘ meus ignis,' etc.

679. pelago is generally taken as abl. with the preposition de
omitted, ‘remains (saved, from the sea‚' etc. C. however thinks
it is the dative, restare being=snpercss2n This is probably right,
since restare de seems to mean ‘ to remain' as a part out of a whole,
as in Ov. Met. 3. 687 ‘de modo viginti . . . Restabam solus.'

680, 681. super is properly used of approaehing a lzz'glc place,
