with Aeneas and his descendants allowed the poet much
latitude in the treatment of his materians, and enabled him to
adapt them as he pleased to the object he had in view. This
object was twofold3 firstly, to reproduce for Roman readers
the manners and institutions of the old heroic age, and to
rival Homer as he had already rivalled Theocritus and
Hesiod3 secondly and chiefly, to celebrate in noble verse
the origin, increase in power, and present greatness of the
Roman people. On both these points the First Book sup-
plies abundant material for illustration. The announcement
of the theme of the poem and its hero and the customary
invocation ofthe Muse are imitated from the opening lines
of the Odyssey and the Iliad respectively. The action
begins, as in the Odyssey, at a critical point in the story, ancl
earlier events are narrated to Dido by Aeneas, just as in
Homer Odysseus relates his previous adventures at the court
of the Phaeacian king Alcinous. The visit of Juno to Aeolus
is suggested by the visit ofthe same goddess (Hera) to Hypnos
or Sleep in the Fourteenth Book of the Iliad, and the sub-
sequent catastrophe is recorded in language closely imitated
from the account of the storin raised by Poseidon in the
Odyssey (5. 291, etc.). Three distinct passages in that poem1
supply the main features in the description of the harbour
in which the shipwrecked Trojans find shelter, Venus
intercedes with Juppiter for her son Aeneas, like Thetis for
Achilles in the First Book of the Iliad, and Mercury’s
mission to Dido is suggested by that of Hermes to
Calypso in the F ifth Book of the Odyssey. Lastly, the
banquet in the halls of Dido and several of its incidentS, such
as the introduction of the bard Iopas and the recital of
Aeneas' adventures at the request of the queen, have their

counterpart in the story of the reception of Odysseus by
Alcinous, to which we haye already alluded.

The more important part of Virgil’s design in the Aeneid—
that of glorifying his nation and celebrating the praisc of
